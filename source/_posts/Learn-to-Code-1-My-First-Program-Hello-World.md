Let's do this, open your most commonly used browser and press "Ctrl + Shift + I" to open the developer tools, then navigate to the developer console.

See the right-angle icon on the screen? Looks like a terminal from a hacker movie, right? Now, you're like an excellent programmer facing a console. Attention! Do not copy any text in this article! Let's type something into the magical terminal: `console.log('Hello, world!');`. Have you finished inputing the code? Now, hit the enter key, and see what happens.

Congratulations! You've finished your first program and it's actually working! Tell me how much time did you spend? It's less than 10 minutes right? In your first program, you used the JavaScript programming language. You used the `console` object, and called the `log` method of it, passing the text "Hello, world!" to the method. After hitting enter, the browser was asked to print it on the terminal window for us. And before start learning how to code, let's first understand what a program is.

We must be familiar with McDonald's, right? Suppose we order a meal and the waiter receives the request and sends it for production. The production unit begins to prepare the ingredients and all the necessary things according to the recipe, going through the production process, controlling many factors such as temperature and time to make a perfect meal. Recipes for producing meals are like programs. Actions in recipes are like statements. Controlling factors such as temperature and time can be considered as variables assigned with appropriate values. So writing a program can be thought of as making a recipe!

Hope this article can give you some confidence in programming. Looking forward to your next programming journey. Until next time! See you in the next LTC learn-to-code session.
