Do you see the right-angle icon on the screen? Look like a terminal from a hacker movie, right? Now, you're like a excellent programmer facing a console. Attention! Do not copy any text in this article! Let's type something into the magical terminal: `console.log('Hello, world!');`. Have you finished inputing the code? Now, hit the enter key, and see what happens.

Congratulations! You've finished your first program and it's actually working! Tell me how much time did you spend? It's less than 10 minutes right? In our first program, we used the JavaScript programming language. We used the `console` object, and called the `log` method of it, passing the text "Hello, world!" to the method. After hitting enter, the browser was asked to print it on the terminal window for us. And actually, we need to first understand what a program is before diving into the code.

Hope this article can give you some confidence in programming. Looking forward to your next program journey. Until next time! See you in the next LTC learn-to-code article.
