Summarizes my growth in 2019, and the next steps in 2020. Three aspects are covered: Dance, art and programming.

## Dance
This is the freestyle record when I just entered [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english/default.htm) (2017/10/08):

And here is another freestyle record at 2020/01/02. After two and half years, the groove is more fluent (be wafer my friend XD) and more creative. Thank to my favorite dancer Henry Link, I learned a lot from him. Not just the skills, but the core concept to dance. Music changed, dance changed. No bad step or move, Locking and Popping somehow invented because of a mistake. Hip - Hop is not just a dance style or MC, DJ or graffiti, it represents a culture. How Bronx New York evolves, is all Hip - Hop. Also learned much from Mr. Wiggles, respect!

And my next step is...... Popping!

## Art
Humm... Illustration, originated character design, and animation are covered under this section.

### Illustration
First public illustration. But actually... the very first illustration made by me is much more terrible than this one.

Sadly, I do not have a piece of artwork that combines all skills I've learned. Here are some, including coloring, light / shading, and perspective.

### Originated Character Design
Character's name is Anassa. Here are four versions of the character.

[1st. version](https://tzuchaowang.artstation.com/projects/PA0b8)
Very...terrible...
![1st. version](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/012/066/211/large/tzu-chao-wang-2018-07-29-anassa.jpg?1532874789)

[2nd. version](https://tzuchaowang.artstation.com/projects/xzDABO)
Body shape is not well designed.
![2nd. version](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/015/975/470/large/tzu-chao-wang-anassa.jpg?1550422417)

[3rd. version](https://tzuchaowang.artstation.com/projects/4bVLJk)
Future and hi-tech version. However it doesn't match my game story, so it was abandoned.
![3rd. version](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/021/090/509/large/tzu-chao-wang-2019-10-06-anassa.jpg?1570372283)

[4th. version](https://tzuchaowang.artstation.com/projects/v1qVJx)
The final version with sailor suit, a high-school girl.

### Animation
About animation, I first tried and created a Live2D model. Now is working on hand-drawn animation.

Live2D animation demonstrations

Hello World
{% youtube _7xW2HVFbX0 %}
Game making plan announcement
{% youtube nqArCbXgBjk %}
And here are plain hand-drawn animations
{% asset_img "Anassa - idle.gif" "Idle'Idle'" %}
{% asset_img "Anassa - flick punch.gif" "Flick punch'Flick punch'" %}
I think the next steps of my art skill growth are...
1. Creates a Live2D model of 4th. version Anassa character.
2. Keeps practicing and creates an illustration that represents my capability of art

## Programming
Programming is hard to explain by pictures. The main growth of my programming skills are the followings I think:
1. Able to quickly understands the system not owned by me and takes actions immediately
2. Integrates major functionalities that seperated in each Fab's own copy of the very very old system. Brings feature toggle ability to the central version so it can be adapted to each Fabs' need
3. Able to learn new framework, programming language in short-time then starts contributing my team

About my self-study, I also learned React.js + Electron, and Unity game engine. Here are the results~

React.js + Electron + Material design: [Swincher project](https://github.com/john29917958/Swincher)

Unity: Anassa game concept demonstration
{% youtube zECGMHpMNtU %}

I think next steps for programming are:
1. Makes stunning Unity game home animiation with Live2D
2. Becomes good at UI / UX design

## Conclusion
Alright here are some growth review of myself after I started working in TSMC about two and half years. Actually I'm not very satisfied with the speed of my growth. I spent too much time for relaxing, playing games, and so on. The next year, my goals are to:
- Be able to perform freestyle solo with Popping just like I'm doing it with Hip-Hop
- Be good at coloring, shading, and perspective art skills. Create an artwork that represents my capability of art
- Be good at Live2D and Unity game design. Make a complete game

These are my targets, what's yours?
