Celebrates the establishment of my [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-tw/) blog!
<!-- more -->
Hooray! I finally created my [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-tw/) blog! In fact, since the previouse year, I'd been wanting to build a personal place for me to record all details of my life, both good and bad memories.
However, there're so many things for me to carry out so... ya... whatever~ At the fourth day from the Chinese New Year 105, I eventually created this site. From now on, it's time for me to keep recording everything that I experienced. Includes programming, technologies, dance, feel, family, friends, dark sides of human beings, warm actions of kind people, and so on.
Hope that I can keep writing my stories on this site to document my wonderful life. And... in the end, Happy New Years everyone. Wish your good health, happiness, and successful life.
