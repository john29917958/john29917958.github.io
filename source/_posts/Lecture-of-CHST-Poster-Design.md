## Chance
This is the last design work for CHST. Right after the Open House Day of CHST, there's a lecture which will be given by two foreign speakers. I want to say thank you CHST. You gave me so many chances for me to sharpen my design skill and thinking. And this is also the last time I design artwork which will be really used in real life.

## Concept
Embarrassing, no concept actually this time. I just took the theme color of UMASS logo (blue) as my poster theme color, gave it some diagoanl, align the text, that's it.

## Result
