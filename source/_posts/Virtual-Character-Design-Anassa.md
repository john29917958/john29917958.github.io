Yeah~ This is my first try of virtual character design!
<!--more-->

## Motivation
Reason that the character was born was, I wanted to make an assistant who can help me schedule my life, give me reminders, provide me suggestions immediately so I can never miss important life events or fail to handle accidents at once. And, there's a character named "Anassa" who represents the entire system. However, I found [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) is yet powerful enough and... It's pretty clear that competing against Google Assistant is a bad choice. Whatever, just for fun~ Time for retargeting the goal of Anassa project, so I can have the differency from Google Assistant ^^"
Oh! The topic of this post is about how Anassa created :P Let's see the details then.

## Character Evolution
Yeah I admit... I take UI and art very seriously ^^". Since the origin customer of the project is me, so a beautiful character **must** be included into the Anassa App (devil face). Be careful, here is the first version of Anassa...

Yuck! Right? The body shape is terrible and the armor is not beautiful. No problem there! The main contribution of such design work is that, setting the main concept to technical look with cyan picked as theme color since I want to combine intelligence, reliability (blue) and vitality (green) together. With the main direction set, I redesigned Anassa...

Here's the second version of Anassa. In the design process, I started to search for anime style body shape samples and took them as references. As you can see... It works XD. The proprtion of entire character is better. In addition to body shapes, I collected some artworks with technical look as well, so more elements with technical feel included in her. Here is the sketch of 2nd. Anassa:

This is the latest version of Anassa character. I made this version since I want Anassa to be more... well... like a normal girl. The previous version of Anassa is more like a robot and is somehow not that approachable and adorable. So I changed her useless body armor into a dress with special patterns (it took me some time to design the pattern = ="). The useless wings changed to translucent mini skirt. Hard and cold armors on the feet changed to black stockings. And, cuter face, too ^^ Also, the color set was reselected. I lowered the saturation of hair color so the entire character looks more comfortable. To keep the technical look, I added additional wings and gems to feet and hands. Following are some design history of the final version of Anassa:

## Next
Now, the look of Anassa should be completed but, there're still a lot of works to be done... Such as refining the entire art picture, combining it with [Live 2D](https://www.live2d.com/en/), importing it into Unity for programming, setting what problem should Anassa solve and locating the target customers... I'll start another sprint of Anassa project after our department monthly meeting and year-end party is ended. Hope I can finally meet the goal I set for myself: Anassa will meet everyone with full body animation between 2019/02/04-09 ^^
