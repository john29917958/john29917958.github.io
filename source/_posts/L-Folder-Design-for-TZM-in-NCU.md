Ah~~ so yearning~ This is my first formal graphic design work. The formal graphic design work means that --> the product I design will be actually used by my customer! In other words, there will be a lot of L folders with the cover I design :)

## The Place I Worked
The chance for me to try my first design work was given by [Taoyan-Hsinchu-Miaoli Regional Education Center](http://www.tzmarea.edu.tw/) in [National Central University](http://www.ncu.edu.tw/). The TZM Education Center is also the first provider of my part-time-job when I was an university student.
I think I should be the luckiest guy in the world because all my first bosses are very warm, kind, friendly, good-natured, considerate,... XD. Every time I got into the office, I felt comfortable and relaxed. We exchanged Christmas presents to each other, we had lunch together, sometimes if someone was tired, we chatted and laughed with each other.
I really love this place. I also very appreciate the chance for me to work as a part-time-job student in the TZM Education Center.

## Chance and Motivation
After working for some time in the TZM, here comes the chance for me to try my first design work.
I can clearly remember that when they told me they need someone to design a new cover of their L folder and asked me whether I'm interested in it or not, I was extremely excited about it and say "Yes" without any hesitation (Hmmm... actually I did have a little hesitation). In fact, as a young folks and a beginner of graphic design, I was afraid of screwing up the design and making their L folder cover ugly. But it was my boss's encouragement that drove me into my hard work without being half-hearted. "It does not matter, I'm willing to cultivate talents." What the hell!? How can you be so nice my dear boss! So, I decided to give my greatest effort to get the design work done.

## Concept
Okay, it's time to start my hard work. Before put myself into the implementation phase, there's one thing to be done first - the main concept of the whole design. If the main concept is not firgured out, the finished product will be scattered. Thus when people first time look at the cover, they must feel *nothing*, not knowing what is it, what purpose of these scattered pictures tell, and what is the main idea it want to deliver.
For my understanding of the TZM Education Center, it's an organization with several units scattered around Taoyan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli. These units cooperate together to provide better educational resources for students. So, I think maybe the puzzle and book can be used to represent the idea of TZM. Each pieces of the puzzle is an unit with specific resources (book). Every pieces provide what they have to compose the complete, powerful educational resource and environment for students. I cannot remember how long did I take to firgue out this main idea, but I'm sure that I was very happy when the key concept of the whole design was born.

## Mistake
After some hard work for the implementation phase, the final product completes. Just couldn't tell how great I feel. I give my design to my boss. Several days later, the L folders were finished and received. After I entered the office, got one L folder and took a loog of it. I was a little disappointed. The color is a little different from the origin source file I gave. It should be more brightly colored and vivid :(
After I Googled some article about this issue, I found out I mistakenly used RGB color format for my design work. While printing the graphic on the physical product, CMYK color format was used. I felt god damn sorry about the mistake I made but everything was late.
This experience gave me a lesson about designing graphic for physical products. After that, I always remember to change the color format to CMYK before I haven't had anything done.

## Result
Alright, the origin RGB PhotoShop source file is missed. So the following are the transformed CMYK version of my design with darken color. It's my first try of designing product for real use. Check it out yo!
