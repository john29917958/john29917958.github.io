2020/12/26, almost the end of the year. I've reached all goals I set in 2019. Do you have any personal or career goals? Here're mine, for your inspiration.

<!--more-->

In 2019, I set {% post_link 2019-Review three expectations to myself %}:
1. Programming: Make a complete game with Unity and Live2D
2. Art: Improve abilities in coloring, shading, and perspective. Make an artwork that demonstrates my level of digital painting
3. Dance: Be able to perform freestyle solo in Popping

Such post is pretty short, here comes the results.

## Make a Complete Game with Unity and Live2D

This is a simple voice controlled mobile action game named "Ha". I think the major difficulty to me is that, it was made by a single person without much game making experience, and was done in spare time. With a {% post_link Ha-The-Game-Development-Review failed experience %}, I took resource management very seriously this time, cut off many many features, abandoned high quality art, and set milestones very carefully. Gladly, it was completed and successfully published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TzuChaoWang.Ha) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/ha/id1534485753), with all the artwork, animation, and program functionalities done by myself.

This piece of work was started from one-point perspective, than rotates objects like notebook and character's shoulder to make two-point perspective in the same system. And it's the first time I applied the concept of oil painting in digital anime style art. Got richer color, got more information effect in such work. Following is the demonstration of perspective lines.

It's the last performance done my me in 2020/12/26. In fact I've been stop dancing a while for the sake of game development. In the performance, I mixed Hip - Hop with Popping in single freestyle show. Originally, I could dance Hip - Hop, but couldn't do the same with Popping. After the 30 days Popping challenge, till now, I can finally control my ability of hitting, and use it in my freestyle performance as I wish.

Here's the latest practice video:

## Expectations 2021
As usual, expectations next year are designed under three talents of myself: Programming (abstract thinking), art, and dancing:
1. Programming: Be good at design pattern and learn all basic Unity client engineering techniques. Produce another game in 2021 with Live2D again
2. Art: Learn "動態構成" concepts, master perspective and coloring skillsets. Produce an artwork combining these skills
3. Dance: Win at least one battle with my integrated abilities of Hip - Hop and Popping

## Final Words
What's your expectations to yourself? Never late, action, NOW! We can be the same person after one year, two year, even ten years. Or we can increase the value we provide to such world. Here's my point of view and belief: Income is just the result based on how significant we can add value to the world. I'm about to do experiment on myself. You can wait, you can keep your life as usual, or you can join the exciting journey with me. Are you ready?
