## Chance
After making a so-so poster for CHST, another chance came for me to try something new. This time, CHST were about to "Open the House" invite high school students. "Open House" means CHST will guide high school students to visit the interior of CHST laboratory.

## Concept
Before I started working on the design phase, my boss told me that the poster can be more lively and fresh. So this time, instead of placing text law-abiding, I did a little rotation to the text on the poster. At that time, I felt good about myself but now when I look at the poster I made, I feel so-so about it. Time changes everything, right? XD
