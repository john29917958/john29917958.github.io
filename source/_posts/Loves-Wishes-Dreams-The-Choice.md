I have a dream. I want to get a web engineer position I love in modern company. I have a wish. I really can't wait to be self-relience so my parents can have easier life. At first, I have strong againstment to research and development alternative service because it requires three years service in total which means I must stay at same company for three years. I will lost my control to my life for totally three years! However, things are unpredictable. [TSMC](http://www.tsmc.com) rushed into my life.

# Lifeline

Before entering the elementary school, one night, my father brought a computer into our room. This is the first time I saw a computer. My first dream blossomed that time after I played a jat game inside the computer. I want to become a game engineer, sharing my joyfulness with people around the world.
From then on, I kept searching on the internet about how to write a game. I created a lot of [Little Fighter 2](http://lf2.net/) characters with animations I made by myself. I fell in love with it.
Life in junior high school and the senior high school is the toughest time in my life. A lot of school works made me unable to sprinkle my creativity to game engineering and anime drawing. Fortunately, I met street dance, I met Hip - Hop, and deeply fell in love with it. It help me got through the toughest time in my life.
Until my third year in my university life, I kept my origin dream in my life. The third year is the most dramatic year for me. In that year, I hurt seriously in a dance showcase rehearsal. A deep wound appeared on my knee with five stitches on it. At this time, I got a chance to be led by Mozilla and started my first open source project named [Travis-Reporter](https://github.com/evanxd/travis-reporter) with my teammates. It gave me a way to forgot all my disappointment. After the Travis-Reporter comes the [NCU Service Desk web project](https://sd.cc.ncu.edu.tw/). From then on, I noticed that there's much more I can do to benefit the whole world instead of making games in my point of view. I started to love web programming. My dream changed, from then on. I decided to become a great web engineer. I will help the world with my professional skills and my passion.
In the twinkling of eye, I became a graduate student in [NCU](http://www.ncu.edu.tw/) [Object-Oriented Lab](http://oolab.csie.ncu.edu.tw/wiki/index.php/OO_Lab). At first, I want to own the TaaS web project of OO Lab with great enthusiasm, however, my professor arranged for me to join a precarious project KORAT.

# Expectation, Kept Changed

Now, I'm at the second year. I'm about to graduate from my graduate school. As you can see on any technical artical, web improves everyday. I did try to catch up with it, but seems like it is a impossible mission for me. Now, I feel like, everything does not matter for me.
First, I want to become a game engineer. It changed after I met Mozilla. I want to be a web engineer. Direction changed again after I joined the Object-Oriented Lab. Now, it really doesn't matter.

# Goodbye My Dreams and My Loves, Hello My Wish

Originally, I don't want to serve three-year research and development alternative service, let along the semiconductor industry [TSMC](http://www.tsmc.com) cause I want to be a web engineer "at first", I love it as well. But with the twists and turns of my direction, it really doesn't matter now. From that night, with a phone call out of the blue, [TSMC](http://www.tsmc.com) rushed into my life. At least, my final wish, I want my parents not to worry about me anymore, is about to come true. I choosed, the [TSMC](http://www.tsmc.com) as my first job. I will servce the three-year research and development alternative service. I don't know if my decision was right. I really don't know... I love art, I love drawing, I love UI / UX design, I love front-end, I love dance, I love music. I found that, all the things I love is about art. But it seems like, there's no space for art to survive in the semiconductor industry [TSMC](http://www.tsmc.com). But finally and at least, a chance for me to realize my wish came. I will not let the chance slip away from me. Goodbye, my loves. See you, my dream. Hello! my wish.
