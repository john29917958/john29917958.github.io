After completed my first artwork for TZM (the L folder cover design), here came another chance for me to hone my ability of graphic designing.

## Chance and Motivation
There's an upcoming meeting for all TZM units. So this time, they need a poster to inform attendees about the schedule and the location of this meeting. I gladly accepted the request directly because I want to redeem myself, correcting the mistake I made last time.

## Concept
By following the main idea of my previous artwork, I still used book to represent the concept of educational resources. But this time, I used a library with a loooot of books instead of a lonely single one. It means the considerable of educational resources they provide. In addition, instead of using orange, I adopted green as the main theme color since green is also the theme color of their logo. And moreover, I wanted to add a little mystery element into my design, so that's why there were some water waves on the final artwork.

## Result
So this is the final production version of the poster. This time I remembered to adjust the color format to CMYK instead of RGB before my implementation stage, cheers!
