In fact, I regard this poster design as a non-successful, a so-so one because I had been stopped working on designing work for a period of time. After a long rest, my skill and my thinking was a little rusty. However, it was the chance (in which I produced an oblation for CHST = =" :P) for me to recover all of my skills and thinking.

## The Place I worked
In the fourth year of my college life, I leaved [the first place I worked in](http://www.tzmarea.edu.tw/) and became the Network Administrator of the [College of Health Science and Technology](http://chst.ncu.edu.tw/). As a Network Administrator, I maintained the web server of CHST, edited the content or changed the style of the web pages. I also did deliver official document and packages of CHST. In this post, the most important is that, I designed posters for them as well.

## Concept
Actually...... I did not desin well = =". More precisely, I struggled when making this artwork. What I can remember is that I felt fresh because I could regain the feeling of designing, but I also felt a little frustrated because I had been not doing art work for too long. What I could think of is this is an seminar for CHST. CHST is the combination of Chemical and Biological. So, I transformed Chemical into capsule, Biological into DNA. THAT's how the final artwork look like XD. Looks general...yeah....
