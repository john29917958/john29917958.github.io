This is my last artwork, also the most successful one for pop dance club in NCU.

## Chance
As the final show came, we practiced together, had meeting together, worked together. As NCU pop dance 21th., this is the last chance for us to hold a dance showcase in the same place. For me, I wanted to leave something meaningful and memorable here. As a beginner of graphic design, it's a little challenge but exciting for me to reach my goal. Although the final artwork was not extremely perfect, I'm satisfied with the effort I'd put and the achievement I made.

## Concept
With the help of the PhotoShop and open source resources, I finally transformed the main concept of our showcase - "五味雜陳" into the way the preview picture shows. The concept "五味雜陳" means that:

> We came from different places with different identities. Because of dance, we met, we got familiar, we became friends, we had trips, we danced. No matter who we are, we formed NCU pop dance 21th., we made this club colorful. This time is the last chance for us to act as the head of pop dance club. We have mixed feelings, but we targeted! We gonna tell you different stories about us, about our memory in NCUPD.

So! A little vicissitudes but with strong, clear target. Color tan with some noise sample should fit this idea well. The people inside head towards the same direction represents that we have strong, clear target. Calligraphy and Standard Kai font give a little enhancement of the vicissitudes feeling. That's how I think and also how the final artwork looks like.
