Today I attended a communication conference in TSMC. The presenter, the leader of Fab 15A, reminded me of many many critical attitudes and mentality that should be always kept in mind throughout entire career path. Here are two that I want to share.

## One Team, Seperated Responsibilities
There's no "hero" or "solo" responsibility in a mature or growing company. However, each departments, each professions should be integrated under the concept of "one team". All departments should move towards the ultimate goal of company together. What does that mean?
Imagine there're two departments: Develop / Deploy, and Security. The develop team is running out of resources, trying their best to deliver product to market for revenue; While the security team sets lots of internal audit items that hold everyone back. For example: Instead of examining the potential product vulnerabilities, "internal network should applies HTTPs for security concern" is proposed. Internal network security has nothing to do with the upcoming product publishing event. The security team keeps wasting resources on irrelevant tasks, pushing the company towards incorrect direction that could put entire company in danger or failure.
That's lacking the concept of "one team". Successful organization has clear R&R, and each teams work together with consistent goal, helping, leading company toward success.

## Be Humble
I'm the best, means limitation. I'm not perfect yet, means advance. "I'm the best" should be self-confidence, not the way we co-works with teammates, not the mentality through our career path.
A form of being humble is "listening". Listening is the far-and-foremost, the first step of resolving a problem. Listening leads to correct analysis and solution design. Also, listening makes customer feel understood, that increases the chance of closing.
On the other hand, I've experienced what Dan Lok says: Always ask powerful questions to yourself about what I don't see, what I don't know. Today I was asked of migrating great amount of functinos from one system to another. But once you listen carefully to your customer, analize the key problem they care, the pain they have, ask about solutions you've heard of but yet unfamiliar with, an easy and simple conclusion can come out.
So always be humble, always listen to your customer, always learn and collect information, then design the most accurate and efficient solution that fit the right person, the right problem, the right requirement.

Here're two key concepts that I regard as "must have" ones for career. What's yours? Comment below. Maybe you can help the lucky guy who read your suggestion~
