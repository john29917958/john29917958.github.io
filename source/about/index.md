Hi, this is Tzu-Chao, I have been doing software maintenance and development in the last six years. I specialized in helping companies design, develop, test, and maintain software projects. In the last six years alone, I have helped TSMC company master git and git flow, and integrate two pairs of projects into one pair using feature toggle concept; I have helped network company master Laravel framework, bring new employee into Bootstrap Laravel project, add new payment method to e-commerce website following the original design, make a RWD web page in two days, fix Apache docker compose script in two days, and that’s what I am passionate about. My real strengths are my ability to develop and maintain high quality JavaScript code, jQuery code, Bootstrap 5 code, Laravel projects, and operate Red Hat Enterprise Linux OSs. I pride myself on my reputation to delivery highly readable JavaScript code and build, publish RWD website to AWS EC2 instance by myself that I know your team likes. What I’m looking for is a company that I could produce highly readable JavaScript code, produce easy-to-find and easy-to-read git histories where I could join a strong team, is this what your company looking for?
