Hi, this is TZU-CHAO, I have been doing software maintenance and development in the last six years. In 2022 I used feature toggle technique to helped TSMC to integrate two pairs of duplicate 15 year old systems to one pair and released it to more than 5 areas, greatly reduced the effort of maintaining the system. I'm passionate about networking and web design. I can work with the team to extend the React web app, to build new web app using ES6 and modularization techniques, and deliver a high-quality small increment every week. During my service at TSMC, I used object-oriented techniques to help TSMC refactor, maintain and develop projects. I'm enthusiastic, I value teamwork, I'm a team player. I have experience in developing team project with Facade design pattern. Are my traits and skills what you looking for?
