## About
Hi this is Tzu-Chao (子超). I have been doing software development for the last five years. I adopted the feature toggle technique to help the TSMC company integrate two similar systems that have run for fifteen years to one. It has been published to four TSMC fabs, reduced over 25% of the maintenance cost for that system. On the other hand, I'm specialized in helping people improving their programming skills. And in the last four months alone, I have helped several clients over four different industries. And these are what I'm passionate about. In addition, I have great enthusiasm for building products. On 24th October 2020 I published a "voice-control" mobile game which has over one hundred downloads within a month and a half, mostly in the U.S. and Taiwan. I pursue challenge and excellence, I pursue Taiwan originality. I'm kind and caring. Are these what you are looking for? Please do not hesitate to contact me.
